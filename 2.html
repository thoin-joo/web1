  <p>This <strong title="굵게">specification</strong> defines the 5th major version, second minor revision of the core language of the World Wide Web: the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/" target="_blank" title="링크, 새로운 탭, 팝업 설명">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a>. In this version, new features continue to be introduced to help Web application authors, new elements continue to be introduced based on research into prevailing authoring practices, and special attention continues to be given to <u title="밑줄">defining</u> clear conformance criteria for user agents in an effort to improve interoperability. <br><br>The implementation report produced for this version demonstrates that in almost every case changes are matched by interoperable implementation. <hr>This specification is a Superseded Recommendation. A newer specification exists that is recommended for new adoption in place of this specification.
